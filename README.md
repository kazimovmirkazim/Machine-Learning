# Machine-Learning
Hi, I’m Mirkazim. This repository represents my personal learning journey in Machine Learning. It’s a collection of structured, technical experiments and code notebooks where I explore core ML concepts, model behaviors, and practical applications. Rather than just implementing models, I focus on understanding why they work, how they fail, and what can be improved.

The notebooks in this repository walk through a range of foundational topics: from decision trees and random forests to overfitting, bias-variance tradeoff, and model evaluation. I apply classification and regression models on sample datasets, visualize decision boundaries using Matplotlib and Graphviz, and break down each result to gain deeper insight. Every experiment includes well-commented Python code, model diagnostics, visual outputs, and brief reflections on what I learned.

The key tools and libraries I use include Python, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Graphviz, and Jupyter Notebooks. My approach is to isolate a concept, test it in a minimal and understandable way, and reflect on how it scales or generalizes. This helps me build strong intuition and prepares me for more complex systems.

The purpose of this repository is not just to store code, but to serve as a reference point for my continuous development as a machine learning practitioner. It’s a transparent showcase of what I know, how I think, and how I approach real-world problems with a mix of analytical rigor and curiosity.

If you're working on similar ideas, learning from scratch, or just exploring how others structure their ML projects, you're welcome to browse, fork, or connect. I’m always open to feedback, thoughtful discussion, or collaboration on shared interests.
